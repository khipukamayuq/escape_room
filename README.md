## CLI text-based escape room 

Code: <Louisville> Jan 2021 Python Final Project

Simple interactive fiction/text-based game.

### About

This is a text based puzzle game inspired by old fashioned point-and-click RPGs (specifically, my fave,
Shadowgate). Unnamed player wakes up in a strange room with no obvious way out. Player can move about the
room, inspect objects, and, potentially, use objects in order to figure out how to escape the room. There's
not actually a lot here. A single riddle can be found. When it is found, it unlocks using a perhaps previously
inspected/used item that will then open the door and end the game.

I had a lot of fun with this, though it needs a good amount of cleanup. I will see adding more here both in
terms of story and puzzles and other interactivity (like, I meant to include a player inventory and the
ability to take items).

### Features implemented:

* master loop
* create class and instantiate an object of that class; populate with data
* create and call 3 functions/methods; set values dynamically. couple `returns` that bring back data used elsewhere
* use regex for text validation
* (a stretch) implemented `___getitem___` within Room class and access items using it; so sorta a dictionary that I'm retrieving values from

### Use

Clone the repo. Only need a Python installation. This was written using Python 3.9.2.

`cd` into the app folder and run `python game.py`.

Starts the loop that is the game. There is a main prompt that runs. Player can make
a selection for one of three actions. Some actions require a target (i.e. a second input)
and will prompt further when necessary. Player is free to explore the room and 
examine or use items in the room. Certain action/options/story-advancement are
only available when conditions have been met.
